# Getting Started with GlassFlow


This example showcases how to get started with GlassFlow to transform your user data in motion.

In this example, we will showcase a hello-world example which enriches a greeting field based on the user's name in the input data. 
We will use GlassFlow python SDK to publish the data to GlassFlow pipeline and use a web-hook sink to receive the transformed events.
