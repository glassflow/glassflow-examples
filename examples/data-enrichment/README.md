This example demonstrates how to use GlassFlow to enrich events data by calling a Geo Location API during the transformation stage. 

## Pre-requisites

- Create your free GlassFlow account via the [GlassFlow WebApp](https://app.glassflow.dev).
- Get your [Personal Access Token](https://app.glassflow.dev/profile) to authorize the Python SDK to interact with GlassFlow Cloud.
