In this tutorial, we will construct a serverless streaming ETL end-to-end data pipeline to analyze Netflix viewing metrics. The surge in Netflix usage has led to a substantial increase in streaming data that demands prompt processing. We’ll simulate a scenario where streaming data from Netflix’s viewership metrics needs to be monitored and processed in real-time to enhance user experience and content delivery. 

A Python script simulates the generation of sample Netflix viewing metrics, which are streamed into AWS Kinesis Data Firehose. 

GlassFlow serves as the central component for real-time data processing and transformation. AWS Firehose acts as the data ingestion service, seamlessly delivering the transformed data to an S3 bucket for further analysis and storage.

The transformed and enriched view metrics data is delivered to an S3 bucket by Firehose. S3 provides durable and scalable storage for the data, allowing Netflix to retain historical metrics for long-term analysis and compliance purposes.

Netflix utilizes analytical tools and services, such as Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon QuickSight, to query, visualize, and derive actionable insights from the stored view metrics data. These insights inform content recommendation algorithms, marketing strategies, and business decision-making processes.
